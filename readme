      ðŸš‰ PROEJECT MODEL FOR ENSURING SAFETY MEASURE FOR UNGUARDED LEVEL CROSSING. ðŸš‰
 This page is intended to be used to understand the hardware model of the unguarded level crossing model.
 

               ðŸš‰  Working Steps for the hardware model:

1.	IR Sensor 1: Placed 1000 cm from the gate. The timer starts from here. 
2.	IR Sensor 2: placed 5cm away from sensor 1.  The timer stops here. 
3.	Train is triggered between these two sensors and final speed is calculated. 
4.	Time is noted 
5.	the distance between the sensors is 5 cm 
6.	speed = d/t 
7.	When the Arduino will calculate that the train is 500 cm away then will send the    instruction to servomotor and the gate will close as the train arrived 
8.	IR Sensor 3: placed at the gate to open the gate again. When object will cross the 3rd IR sensor then after delay of 10 sec gate will open. 
9.	LCD Display: Displays messages and the calculated speed of the train. 
10.	Servomotors: Controls the opening and closing of the barricades. 

                   ðŸš‰ MODEL PICTURED ON THE WEBPAGE:

1. Monitor Train Data: Displays real-time distance and speed of the train.
2. Progress Bar Visualization: Shows the train's approach to the gate with a dynamic progress bar.
3. Automatic Gate Control: Closes the gate automatically when the train is less than 500 cm away.
4. Manual Gate Control: Allows users to manually open or close the gate using buttons.
5. Gate Reopening: Automatically reopens the gate 10 seconds after the train passes.
